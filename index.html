     <p id="p1" class="style">Many people buy pc for first time,they buy pre-built pc,but pre-built pc's are expensive and not upto the power of custom pc's in the same price range.In this content I would tell you all about pc's and what to buy in every budget range.</p>

    <h4 id="processor" class="heading"><strong>processor</strong></h4>
    <p id="p2" class="style">processor is pc most important part of a pc and it decides what you really want to do with it you want to game or use it for programming or do both.Processor is brain of a pc.
    slecting a processor you would come around terms like "core,Threads,GHZ".not to be confused
    a single core is small processsor withn a large processors and threads are virtual(not physical) cores.GHZ is frequency of how many cycle can cpu complete in 1 second(3.0GHZ to 4.0GHZ).What types of things you want to do with the pc decides,what processor you need and with how many cores?.If you want to game minimum 4 core processor with good single core performance will be enough.If you want to do productive work like editing,rendering and programming etc you might need 6 cores or above with processor capabale of multi-threading.You might be confused in what processor you want to by and from which company to make things easy for you i will briefly describe both company and which companies processor are better for which purposes.Their are mainly to companies inside consumer based processor market.</p><p><!--breif description of processors and what the do-->

    <ul id="ul1" class="bullets">
    	<p id="p3" class="style"><li><strong>INTEL</strong></li>intel is a better option for gaming if your budget is high</p>
    	<p id="p4" class="style"><li><strong>AMD</strong></li>AMD is a better option for budget as it provide a bang for the buck performance.</p>
    </ul>
    <p id="p5" class="style">When searching online you would have found confused seeing so many options for processors core i3,core i7,ryzen 3 blah blah blah its quiet confusing if you are new to pc i will briefly describe what they actually mean so you will not be confused.As i said there are only two companies that make processor like Intel and Amd.</p>
    <ul id="ul2" class="bullets">
    	<p id="p6" class="style"><li><strong>INTEL</strong></li>There is three models like i3,i5 and i7 nad more expensive i9 model.</p>
    </ul>
    <ol id="ol1" class="numbers">
    	<p id="p7" class="style"><li class="bullets-numbers">core i3</li>These are processors family which have 2 cores and hyper-threading(a feature which help in multi-tasking) core i3 also have generation to know which generation you look at the number after core i3-'1'means 1st generation and core i3-"2" means second generation and vice versa.With each increasing generation technology and power increases.It is entry-level processors used for entry level pc's.</p>
    	<p id="p8" class="style"><li class="bullets-numbers">core i5</li>These are processors family which have 4 cores,hyperthreading and boost.These also have generations like i3 and follows same rule.It is used in mid-range pc's.</p>
    	<p id="p9" class="style"><li class="bullets-numbers">core i7</li>These processors family which have 6 cores,hyperthreading and boost.These also have same generation like the above 2.it is used in high and mid-range pc's.</p>
    	<p id="p10" class="style"><li class="bullets-numbers">core i9</li>These processors family which have 8 cores,hyperthreading and boost.These also have same generation like the above 2 but i9 only have 9th gen nad above.it is used in high and expensive pc's.</p>

    <p id="p14" class="style">i have already told you about processor what they do and know i will tell where to put them</p>
    <h5 id="motherboard" class="heading">Motherboard</h5>
    <p id="p15" class="style">Motherboard is essential part of a pc this is where all other part of pc like processor,ram,graphics card and memory are assembled on to and talk to eachother.Echh motherboard has a different chipset so to know if your processor is compatible see which chipset dos your processor fit in it usually present in the title.So you to buy a good motherboard you need to ask these question to yourself,How much memory you need and which type of memory(i will explain it later in "<a href="#content" ><strong>RAM</strong></a>" title)?How much upgradibility you need?how many <a href="#storage"><strong>STORAGE</strong></a>  like SSD,HDD will you need?.To not confuse you every motherboard looks the same because there ports are alike i will show you the photo of motherboard and explain what is in it part by part.</p>

    <ol id="ol3" class="numbers">
    	<p id="p16" class="style"><li><strong>SOCKET</strong></li>This where processor goes each motherboard has this but with different chipset.Compare your processsor chipset number to motherboard chipset number if they are same your motherboard is compaitible with your processor.</p>
    	<p id="p17" class="style"><li><strong>RAM SLOTS</strong></li>Motherboard above has four ram slot some have 2 its on you that how much RAM would you need that will be deciding how many RAM slot would you need on you motherboard.Usually expensive motherboard have 4 RAM slot.Ech motherboard support different kind of memory some support DDR3(old memory usually old motherboard support this much slower speed and old technology) and some support DDR4(new memory buy motherboard which support this).</p>
      <p id="p18" class="style"><li><strong>12-PIN CONNECTOR</strong></li>this is where motherboard gets it power.It is standard in all modern motherboard.This is where your 12-pin connector of <a href="#">POWER SUPPLY</a>is connected.</p>
      <p id="p19" class="style"><li><strong>PCI EXPRESS SLOT</strong></li>pci express slot is slot where you can put many cards like graphics card,ssd and wifi.</p>
     <ul id="ul4" class="bullets">
      <p id="p20" class="style"><li><strong>NOTE</strong></li>only things that can fit into this slot can be used but mainly it it used for graphics card because of its speed of data transfer.</p>
     </ul>
      <p id="p21" class="style"><li><strong>SATA PORTS</strong></li>These port an be connectes to a device which supports sata ports.Usually these ports are used for SSDs and HDDs.These ports are also used for data tranfer and are little slower than you PCI epress slot but the devices it supports are much cheaper to buy.</p>
    </ol>
    <p id="p22" class="style">Other features like M.2 slots are included is modern motherboard this slot supports M.2 SSDS which are much faster and duraible but much more expensive</p>
    <h6 id="content" class="heading"><strong>RAM</strong></h6>

    <p id="p23" class="style">There are two type of RAMs one is Static RAM and other is Dynamic RAM.Deskstop uses the Dynamic RAM in short DDR RAMs.EACH DDR has a generation DDR is 1st generation DDR2 is second and it is available till DDR4 4th generation.Each generation is better than the last one the most recent DDR4 is one of the fastest and powerful RAM in desktop use today and also more expensive.RAM is fastest excessible storage your computer uses to run programs it can safe things like you minimizing your chrome and coming back but if you shut your computer data stored on this RAM is lost.RAM is only used to excess a file fast.Each RAM comes with Different frequency higher the number faster the RAM 1600mhz is normal in DDR4 and 2600 mhz in DDR4 it can go higher upto 4000mhz but they are more expensive.Before choosing which generation ram you want to buy look at your motherboard and see what generation of RAM does your motherboard support and in what does your motherboard upport RAM speed.Buying higher frequency of RAM and your motherboard supports lower frequency than RAM frequency it will lower the RAM freqency where motherboard supports it wasting the speed it does not use.</p>
    <h7 id="storage" class="heading"><strong>STORAGE</strong></h7>
    <p id="p24" class="style">To store anything in a pc permanatly 2 things are used 1)HDD 2)SSD there is considered difference between these two.I will explain briefly these two.</p>

    	<p class="style" id="p25"><li><strong>HDD</strong></li>Is a mechanical Storage,HDD stands for Hard disk drive,is much slower than SSD and not as much relaible as SSD(As HDD has moving parts).And is much cheaper than SDD used for high capacity storage.</p>

    	<p id="p26" class="style"><li><strong>SSD</strong></li>Is solid storage,SSD stands for Solid-state drive,is much faster than HDD and reliable(As it does not have moving parts).And usually use for as a boot device as it is more expensive than HDD.There is also M.2 SSD which is a performance SSD and much faster than SSD which uses SATA ports.</p>

    <p id="p27" class="style">Graphic card is integral part of a gaming pc without it you cannot play game unless you have APU(processor which have both CPU and GPU).And without a didecated graphics card you cannot play gmae on a higher quality.Which graphic card to buy depends on how much you wanna spend on it.There is only two companies that make GPU 1)Nvadia 2)AMD.If you want to buy a graphic and have lower budget and want to only play games buy AMD Its RX 500 series GPU are cheap and powerful(buy it carefully as they are used for mining check before buying)and if you have higher budget and also want to do productive work and stream buy nvadia,in budget catagory nvadia have its GTX 1600 cards(dont buy nvadia lower card as you will compromise on performane).</p>
